## üìå Projects & Research

### TriMed Driver & Patient Apps  
- **Problem:** In underdeveloped regions (e.g., Bangladesh, Indonesia), ambulance fees can exceed half a family‚Äôs monthly income, leaving emergencies without affordable transport.  
- **Solution:** Developed two cross-platform apps in React Native + Expo‚Äîone for drivers, one for patients‚Äîusing Firebase Auth and Firestore. Drivers receive real-time ride requests and navigate via Google Maps API; patients request emergency pickups and track incoming vehicles live.  
- **Result:** Both apps launch requests and route drivers instantly, reducing transport costs by up to 90% compared to local ambulances; ready for a 50-user pilot in September 2025.  
- **Stack:** React Native, Expo, Node.js backend, Firebase Auth, Firestore, Google Maps API  


### REACH (iOS App)  
- **Problem:** College students lacked a campus-specific platform to share course and internship reviews.  
- **Solution:** Developed a React Native app inspired by Reddit + Glassdoor. Verified via school email, users can post, rate, and search content. Backend uses Node.js and AppWrite for auth and real-time data.  
- **Result:** Core social feed, rating, and search features are implemented; UI components styled with Tailwind CSS. App is ready for integration with live data.  
- **Stack:** React Native, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, AppWrite  



### CHERground POS System  
- **Problem:** The existing fashion-retail POS backend was slow, monolithic, and prone to deadlocks under high transaction volume.  
- **Solution:** Refactored service in TypeScript + Express with TypeORM using Clean Architecture and dependency injection. Optimized database with batch inserts, query caching, and indexed columns.  
- **Result:** Reduced average checkout latency by 70% and fully eliminated deadlocks during peak usage.  
- **Stack:** TypeScript, Nest.js, Express, TypeORM, MySQL, Docker, Slack

### Movie Ticketing Web App (Bootcamp)  
- **Problem:** Needed a scalable backend to serve movie listings, seat reservations, and user reviews under concurrent load, plus social login.  
- **Solution:** Built Django REST API, integrated Kakao OAuth for authentication, containerized with Docker, and deployed behind an AWS Application Load Balancer across multiple EC2 instances.  
- **Result:** Delivered a robust booking system with real-time seat availability, seamless social login, and horizontal scaling.  
- **Stack:** Python, Django, Docker, AWS EC2 & RDS, Kakao OAuth, Trello, Slack

### E-Commerce Web App (Bootcamp)  
- **Problem:** Recreate a full-featured e-commerce platform with user accounts, product catalogs, shopping carts, and reviews.  
- **Solution:** Implemented Django REST endpoints for signup/login, product CRUD, cart management, reviews, ‚Äúlikes,‚Äù and point-based ordering. Collaborated in two-week Agile sprints via Slack & Trello.  
- **Result:** Launched a production‚Äêready prototype on AWS EC2 with RDS backend, covering all core e-commerce workflows.  
- **Stack:** Python, Django, MySQL, AWS EC2 & RDS, GitHub, Trello, Slack
